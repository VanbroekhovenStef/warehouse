# Utopia 2.0
Utopia is comprised of three main sections:
- The game itself is made in the Unity game engine
- A microservices back-end takes care of all the data storage and processing
- A web application that hosts the Unity game and allows some extra functionality

## Game engine
Utopia 2.0 is made in the Unity game engine. This platform allows the programmer to use lots of features that help in creating a game, which normal web development platforms do not offer.

Data is stored in a microservices oriented 

## Back-end
For documentation of the back-end we refer to the `edge-service`, where all information about the microservice architecture is gathered. Information on the different services used, how to run the services locally and ways of testing are mentioned there.
